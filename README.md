*Password Generator - Homework 3

Starting with the code that has been provided to us, I will make updates to the JavaScript code provided to make the generator work.

The code will prompt for the user to provide if they would like to provide specifications for the password, 
if so, it will ask for length of password and if they want special characters.

The length of the password must be between 8 and 128 characters. The user will have the opportunity to decide what characters are included.

If no selection is made when determining the characters of the password, then the password will not be generated.
